Various scripts and utilities for assisting teaching including grading

These scripts came about from repetitive tasks I wanted to automate while grading.
There are other repositories for MySchool and CANVAS related tools
* MyCanvas:  abstraction layer and tools for CANVAS https://github.com/ru-engineering/mycanvas
* RU Canvas Tools:  RU internal tools for CANVAS (private) https://projects.cs.ru.is/projects/canvas-tools

Tool Overview
* bind-pdfs.sh: automates binding pdfs together from feedback forms
* extract-pdf-annotations.py: Grabs text comments from PDF to enable automated grading
* listcalc.py: takes lists of numbers from standard input and outputs a calculated grade
* presentation-cutter.py: Cut scans of presentation feedback (multiple per page) and re-collate them by individual presentation
